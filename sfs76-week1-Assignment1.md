### Paragraphs about myself:

Hello, my name is Samiha Shoshi. I am a Web designer and developer, currently working on my bachelor's degree at Drexel University. I grew up in a house with two little sisters, and surrounded my a large supportive family.

I love trying new thing and making the most from what I have. As we all know life can be very chaotic at times, but its what you do with the chaos that defines you. I use the chaos in my life as inspriration in my creative thinking when designing. 

A little known fact about me is that I set goals for myself and always acheive them. I always give a 110% effort into everything I do and always keep my promises. These are three of the millions of valuable lessons I learned from seeing my parents work day and night to provide for our whole family. Infact, I was able to become Vice President of Phi Theta Kappa and get a promotion to Shift Leader in less then 3 months because of the unspoken lesson I was surrounded with from all the hardships my parents faced. 

Lastly, I strongly believe that family does not just include your blood relatives. Family include everyone that love and supports you and your goals. When it come to my clients, I see them as apart of my family. Apart of my mission as your web designer and developer is to support and help you acheive your goals as a business. Please feel free to contact me at any time!
